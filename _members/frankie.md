I am currently a research assistant in the Visual Cognition Laboratory. I earned my psychology degree from Lingnan University, where I developed a deep passion for the field. I am passionate about psychology because I enjoy designing and conducting experiments to investigate how our cognitive system works. My research interests include visual perception and metacognition, with my thesis focusing on how serial dependence affect our confidence judgement and metacognitive system.
