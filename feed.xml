This Hong Kong based conference was held at the same picturesque location as last year (Lingnan University Space at M+), with attendees were treated to stunning views of the harbour. This year’s conference was extended to two days, a testament to its growing success and the increasing number of scholars and professors eager to present their research.</p>

<p>The conference commenced with welcoming speeches from Prof. Will Hayward, the Dean of the Social Science Faculty, and Prof. Siu Oi Ling, the Head of Department of Psychology. Their words set an inspiring tone for the event, acknowledging the importance of the gathering and the exciting discussions that awaited us.</p>

<p>The morning session was dedicated to social neuroscience, featuring three riveting presentations. Prof. Xiaoqing Hu from University of Hong Kong kicked things off with a fascinating exploration of memory editing during sleep. Prof. Rongjun Yu from Hong Kong Baptist University followed with insights into the neural science of Machiavellianism, while Dr. Jie Hu from East China Normal University delved into deconstructing the dynamic of altruistic decision-making.</p>

<p>A new addition to this year’s conference was a short presentation session for undergraduate and postgraduate students, aimed at encouraging young scholars and providing them a taste of the academic presentation experience. Students from various universities in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area showcased their impressive works in tightly timed segments of three minutes, followed by a two-minute Q&amp;A. This fast-paced and competitive format added an exciting edge to conclude the morning session and was a delight for all who attended. The students rose to the occasion, delivering fantastic talks that impressed professors and peers alike. The best student presentation award went to Richard Tian, a PhD student from HKUST.</p>

<p>After a fruitful lunch break, the afternoon session shifted focus to perception, with four presentations lined up. Our first keynote speaker, Prof. Isabel Gauthier from Vanderbilt University, provided deep insights into whether there is a domain-general object recognition. This was followed by Dr. Ayelet Sapir from University of Greenwich, who discussed 3D perception and ageing. After a refreshing coffee break, Prof. Jing Samantha Pan from Sun Yat-sen University captivated the audience with her talk on perception-action unity. The final keynote speaker of the day, Prof. Pascal Mamassian from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris, closed the session with an engaging presentation on distinguishing serial from parallel processing in visual confidence judgments</p>

<p>The day concluded with Will offering his final words, perfectly wrapping up an exhilarating day of academic exchange.</p>

<p>The second day of the conference continued despite heavy rain, at our main campus. The day’s presentations were equally engrossing. Charles Leek from University of Southampton discussed the association of COVID-19 and global cognitive impairment in post hospitalisation patients, shedding light on timely and critical issues. Dr. Luyan Ji from Guangzhou University followed with a presentation on two faces of holistic face processing, and finally, Prof. Haiyang Jin from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University concluded with an enlightening talk on automatic ensemble coding of multiple facial expressions.</p>

<p>In summary, the conference was a resounding success, marked by insightful presentations, dynamic discussions, and meaningful networking. Here’s to the continued growth and success of this conference—looking forward to next year’s gathering!</p>]]></content><author><name>frankie</name></author><category term="conference" /><category term="events" /><category term="cognitive science group" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, we had the pleasure of attending the second annual “ Neurocognitive Pathways: Understanding Perception and Social Processing in the brain” conference, hosted by the Cognitive Science Group and the Department of Psychology in Lingnan University.

Speakers from across the world came to share their recent research, from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Korea, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Our backdrop was the stunning view of the beautiful Victoria Harbour, as we utilised the amazing space Lingnan University has at M+. Attendees and speakers alike were able to enjoy morning coffee break, lunch, and afternoon coffee break with views of the harbour and cultural district. The opportunity to connect with fellow researchers and learn about the advancements in the visual cognition field was invaluable.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Vice President for Research and Innovation at Lingnan University, Prof. Xin Yao, and the Head of Lingnan’s Department of Psychology, Prof. Siu Oi Ling, delivered welcome speeches.</p>

<p>Our first keynote speaker was Prof. Charles Leek (University of Liverpool). The topic of deep neural networks (often used in the engineering and computer science field) and how it can be applied to visual cognition research conducted by psychological researchers was thought-provoking and intriguing.</p>

<p>The following morning talks from researchers based here in Hong Kong showed the exciting and novel research happening in this part of the world. Dr. Dorita Chang (University of Hong Kong) spoke on eye dominance and binocular vision training, and Prof Janet Hsiao (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) shared her person perception research on recognition of faces and eye-movement patterns with an emphasis on deep neural networks and hidden Markov models.</p>

<p>After the very satisfying and fulfilling lunch provided, we had three incredible talks: our very own Prof Yi Huang from Lingnan University delved into the ageing brain and how it impacts decision making, particularly exploring their changes in emotion and motivation as mediators. Prof Ruida Zhu (Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou) spoke about moral choices in perceptual tasks and neurocomputational mechanisms. Before we enjoyed some afternoon coffee and food, Prof Dongil Chung (UNIST Korea) also presented research related to decision-making with an emphasis on how decision-making behaviours change based on whether we are observed by others and observing others.</p>

<p>The conference was concluded by the final keynote speaker: Prof Paul Corballis, (University of Auckland, New Zealand). He aimed to inspire us with a vast number of directions that human perception research could take. I think the most intriguing of the topics for all in attendance was the Ghostalt concept (a clever play on words combining Gestalt [the perception of a whole from the sum of its parts] and Ghosts). Whereby, we could potentially think of ghost sightings by grieving loved ones as a similar experience to phantom limb syndrome.</p>

<p>The first Lingnan University Department of Psychology conference was a huge success! The opportunity to hear the research being conducted across the world and network with fellow vision and neurological researchers was invaluable.</p>

<p>Can’t wait for the conference next year!</p>]]></content><author><name>dana-walker</name></author><category term="conference" /><category term="events" /><category term="cognitive science group" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Department of Psychology at Lingnan University, Hong Kong was proud to host our first Lingnan University Psychological Conference after the COVID pandemic - From Neurons to Consciousness: The Brain Basis for Cognition on May 2nd 2024.
