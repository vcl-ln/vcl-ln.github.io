# Development of Face Familiarity

### Project Description
Have you ever gone to a social gathering, met new people, and thought: “how am I going to remember all these new people’s names and faces?”. Arguably, one of the most embarrassing situations is when you cannot remember the face or name of someone you have previously met!

Recognising a familiar face is often important for successful social interaction. So, how do new faces become familiar over time and what mechanisms underlie this process? This multistage project, focusing on learning East Asian faces by East Asian participants, utilises a range of behavioural tasks, EEG, and eye-tracking to better understand the process of face familiarity.
